After that, you will die.

You didn\'t give me changethe last time

Get up.

What happened?

I don\'t know him.

I haven\'t seen him before.

He tried to attack you onlyafter knowing everything about you.

He is right here!- Hey!

He is right here!- What are you saying?

I am sure he is right here!

Don\'t talk rubbish.- Hey! Look there!

There\'s electricity there,but there\'s no electricity here.

He is right here!- Don\'t panic.

He is right here!- I am with you! We will deal with him.

He is right here!

He disconnected the power supplyin the electric poll outside.

I told you he is right here!- Be quiet.

Take it, stay right here.

He might be somewhere inside;I will go and deal with him.

If he is inside, kill him.- Be quiet.

Where is the torch?- Beside the television.

Why did you come here?- I am scared.

Come.

Did he get scared seeing you?

I don\'t think so.

He attacked you with a dagger.

If he is here,he will surely come looking for you.

Buddy...- Come.

I am with you, come.

Do you have cigarette?

Hello!

Don\'t! Please don\'t kill me!

Be alert! Take position!

What do you have to sayabout the security?

Come. People should fearto even look at your store.

You have no idea how powerful I am.

If I get a hold on him...

Cheers!

Darn it.- Who is it?

It\'s her.

Hello.- Who is this?

It\'s me.- Who are you?

You often see me in his store.- It\'s Pandi sir.

Please don\'t trouble him.

Then what do I do?- Trouble me if you want.

When I returned home,it was very dark.

Those who accompanied me got scared.

When I entered the housebravely looking for him

I found something movinginside the sack

I thought it was the attacker

and went close and removed the sack

our friend screamed\'Please don\'t kill me\'.

\'Please don\'t kill me\'.

It was so funny.

He is such a coward.

But the only wise thingour friend did was

he called me.- That\'s right.

Else he would\'ve died.Am I right, buddy?

Anything might\'ve happened yesterday

but it\'s not the same today.</string>
